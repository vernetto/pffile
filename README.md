Sample minimalistic project to upload and download files.

On Windows the files are stored in d:\temp, in Linux on /var/temp

Tested only up to 30 MB files

Files are stored with same name. Subsequent uploads override the previous ones.

Cloned from https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces-test and added functionality
